# Foundation: a Rails 6 template project

The **master** branch is the fully configured template, ready to be used as the starting point of a project.

Other branches:
* **rails-new**: The result of `rails new foundation` - you can add components individually by basing a new branch on this branch and then merging the components that you want. A minimal controller and view for `home#index` is included and set as the default route.
* **add-bootstrap**:
* **add-navbar**:
* **add-devise**:

## Base Rails App

Create a new Rails app:

`rails new foundation` (branch: **rails-new**)

`rails g controller home`

### home#index

For now, an empty `index` method and a trivial `views/home/index.html.erb` will do the trick:

```ruby
def index
end
```

```html
<h1>Foundation</h1>
```

The home controller gives us just enough to set up and test the other components and a target for Devise.

## Styling

### With Bootstrap 4

Using Adrian Teh's approach from [Ruby on Rails 6 with Webpacker and Bootstrap][teh], including support for emitting separate CSS files for the `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper.

It appears that once you enable emitting separate CSS, you must use the `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper to include CSS that is managed by Webpack.

It also appears that each stylesheet that you want to pick up from `app/assets/stylesheets` has to be listed individually in `app/javascript/stylesheets/application.scss`.

#### Using MD Bootstrap

### [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

A less "opinionated" alternative to Bootstrap.

### [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com)

#### With Sprockets

* [bootstrap-rubygem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem)

#### With Webpack

#### References

* [Ruby on Rails 6 with Webpacker and Bootstrap][teh] (July 2019) - Uses [Webpack][], but keeps the stylesheets in `app/assets/stylesheets`.
The code is available on GitHub at: [AdrianTeh/HelloWorldWebpacker](https://github.com/AdrianTeh/HelloWorldWebpacker), however it assumes you have Postgress for your database and it expects Ruby 2.6.3.

### [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

## The Navbar

The navbar is the example [Bootstrap navbar][navbar] from the Bootstrap documentation, stored as a partial in `views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb`. It is rendered by a call from `views/layouts/application.html.erb`.

Many of the links in the navbar should be generated by the `link_to` helper.

1. `bundle install`
1. `rails g devise:install`
1. Do manual commands output by `devise:install`
1. `rails g devise user`
1. `rails db:migrate`
