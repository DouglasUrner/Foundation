# TL;DR

The **master** branch is the fully configured template, ready to be used as the starting point of a project.

Other branches:
* **rails-new**: The result of `rails new foundation` - you can add components individually by basing a new branch on this branch and then merging the components that you want. A minimal controller and view for `home#index` is included and set as the default route.
* **add-bootstrap**:
* **add-navbar**:
* **add-devise**:
* **add-rails-settings**:
* **add-fontawesome**:

# How it was built

## Base Rails App

Create a new Rails app:

`rails new foundation` (branch: **rails-new**)

`rails g controller home index`

### home#index

For now, an empty `index` method and a trivial `views/home/index.html.erb` will do the trick:

```ruby
def index
end
```

```html
<h1>Foundation</h1>
```

The home controller gives us just enough to set up and test the other components and a target for Devise.
