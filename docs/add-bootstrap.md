# Adding [Bootstrap 4][bootstrap]

Using Adrian Teh's approach from [Ruby on Rails 6 with Webpacker and Bootstrap][teh], including support for emitting separate CSS files for the `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper.

It appears that once you enable emitting separate CSS, you must use the `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper to include CSS that is managed by Webpack.

It also appears that each stylesheet that you want to pick up from `app/assets/stylesheets` has to be listed individually in `app/javascript/stylesheets/application.scss`.

## With Webpack


## With Sprockets

* [bootstrap-rubygem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem)

## Views Modification


### The Navbar

The navbar is the example [Bootstrap navbar][navbar] from the Bootstrap documentation, stored as a partial in `views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb`. It is rendered by a call from `views/layouts/application.html.erb`.

Many of the links in the navbar should be generated by the `link_to` helper.
