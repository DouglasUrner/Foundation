# Add Simple Form

1. Get the [Gemfile reference from RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_form) and add it to your Gemfile.
1. Follow the instructions in the [**heartcombo/simple_form**][simple-form] repository on GitHub. Use the Bootstrap install:

  `rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap`

  This appears to pull in [**rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap**][simple-form-bootstrap] for you.

* [**nathanvda/cocoon**](https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon) - adds support for nested (multi-model) forms, mentions support for Rails 3-5, but says nothing about 6. Looking at the issue queue it appears that in early 2020, it can be made to work, see [**Move to Yarn?**](https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon/issues/555).
